# Google Contacts endpoint

## Overview
The Google Contacts endpoint is a user endpoint (see [Global vs user endpoints](https://slingr-stack.github.io/platform/app_development_model_endpoints.html#global-vs-user-endpoints)), 
which means that each user should connect to the endpoint.

This endpoints hides most of the complexities of the [Google Contacts API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v3/)
to make it easier to work with it, however not all features are available. Here is what's supported by the endpoint:

- Authentication and authorization
- Find, create, update and delete contacts
- Find, create, update and delete groups
- Events when contacts are created, updated or deleted on Google

For more information please refer to [docs](https://slingr-stack.github.io/platform/endpoints_google_contacts.html).
